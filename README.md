# Sentiment Analysis with NLP (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)

## 📌 Internship Task – Task 2

This project performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

### 🔹 Objective
To classify customer reviews into positive and negative sentiments using:
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression

### 🔹 Dataset
The dataset contains customer reviews and sentiment labels:
- `1` → Negative sentiment  
- `2` → Positive sentiment  

Due to memory constraints, a random sample of 50,000 reviews was used for training.

### 🔹 Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, special character removal)  
3. Feature extraction using TF-IDF  
4. Model training using Logistic Regression  
5. Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  

### 🔹 Results
- Accuracy: ~84%
- The model effectively classifies positive and negative reviews.

### 🔹 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
